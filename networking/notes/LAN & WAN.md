# LAN & WAN

### Introduction

In this section, we'll focus on two types of core networks: **LAN** and **WAN**. These are fundamental to understanding how devices communicate in both **small** and **large** environments.

### Local Area Network (LAN)

A **LAN** (Local Area Network) is a network that connects devices within a **small area**, such as your home or office. It allows devices to **communicate** and **share resources** locally.

- **Example**: Think of your **home Wi-Fi network**. It connects devices like your laptop, phone, and printer. When you print a document from your laptop to a printer in your home, you are using a LAN.

- **Typical Use Cases**:
  1. **Connecting Computers**: LANs are commonly used to connect computers, printers, and other devices in a single location, such as a home or office.
  2. **Sharing Files and Resources**: Devices within a LAN can **share files** and **resources** locally.
  3. **Internet Access**: LANs provide internet access to all devices within a confined area.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

A **WAN** (Wide Area Network) covers a much **larger area** than a LAN. WANs connect multiple LANs and enable communication and data transfer over **long distances**.

- **Example**: The **internet** is the largest and most common example of a WAN. It connects homes, schools, businesses, and devices across the globe.

- **Purpose**:
  - WANs are like a **massive international highway system** for data.
  - They connect multiple LANs, allowing **communication** between networks over long distances.

### Conclusion

While there are many types of networks, **LAN** and **WAN** are the **primary focus** here. LANs allow communication and resource sharing within small areas, like homes and offices. WANs enable data communication over large areas, such as the internet, by connecting multiple LANs.

LANs and WANs form the foundation for understanding how networks operate in both **small** and **large-scale environments**.
